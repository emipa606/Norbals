  <!-- EN: These people have been here a very long time. Maybe their ancestors crashed here a thousand years ago. Maybe they survived some cataclysm that destroyed a technological civilization here. In any case, the norbals are mostly nomadic people who live off the land using primitive tools and weapons.\n\nSome clans are more aggressive than others; many are open to trade and alliances, even with strange peoples like yourselves. Close cooperation or recruitment will be very difficult because of the vast sociotechnological and linguistic gap between the norbals and yourselves.\n\nDespite their apparent technological weakness, the norbals can be dangerous enemies and valuable friends because of their skill with low-tech warfare, their numbers, and their hardiness. -->
  <NorbalTribe.description>这些人已经在这里生活了很长时间。也许他们的祖先一千年前就坠毁在这里了。也许他们在摧毁了这里的科技文明的大灾难中幸存了下来。无论如何，诺巴人大多是游牧民族，他们使用原始工具和武器，靠天吃饭。

有些部族比其他部族更具侵略性</NorbalTribe.description>
