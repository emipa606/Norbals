Behold the Norbals of the Rim, Fearless and hairy! They wouldn&amp;apos;t be so strong if they&amp;apos;d live beerless and without dairy
it kinda rhymes and that&amp;apos;s the point so hide your dimes cause they&amp;apos;ll wreck your joint! &amp;quot;Hurf&amp;quot; says the proud Rimkins, the Norbals of the north!

Vikings, they&amp;apos;re tougher than normal human beings and thrive in colder climates
really, really hate heat.
