--- Original Description ---
Behold the Norbals of the Rim, Fearless and hairy! They wouldn't be so strong if they'd live beerless and without dairy
it kinda rhymes and that's the point so hide your dimes cause they'll wreck your joint! "Hurf" says the proud Rimkins, the Norbals of the north!

Vikings, they're tougher than normal human beings and thrive in colder climates
really, really hate heat.</description>
