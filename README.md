Behold the Norbals of the Rim, Fearless and hairy! They wouldn&apos;t be so strong if they&apos;d live beerless and without dairy
it kinda rhymes and that&apos;s the point so hide your dimes cause they&apos;ll wreck your joint! &quot;Hurf&quot; says the proud Rimkins, the Norbals of the north!

Vikings, they&apos;re tougher than normal human beings and thrive in colder climates
really, really hate heat.
